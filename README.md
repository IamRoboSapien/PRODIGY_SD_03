# PRODIGY_SD_03
# **SUDOKU SOLVER** 

## Project Title
**Sudoku Solver using Backtracking Algorithm in C**

---

## Technology Used
- **Programming Language:** C  
- **Concepts:** Backtracking, Recursion, 2D Arrays  
- **Tools:** GCC/Clang compiler, any IDE (Code::Blocks, VS Code, etc.)

---

## Features of the Project
- Solves any valid Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.  
- Displays the unsolved grid and the solved grid clearly.  
- Uses recursion to explore possible solutions efficiently.  
- Validates numbers based on Sudoku rules (row, column, 3×3 subgrid).  
- Simple and easy-to-understand code structure.  

---

## Process
- **Input Grid:** Sudoku puzzle is represented as a 9×9 matrix (0 = empty cell).  
- **Validation:** Checks if a number can be placed in a given cell.  
- **Backtracking:** Recursively tries numbers 1–9, backtracks if invalid.  
- **Solution:** Stops when all cells are filled correctly.  
- **Output:** Prints the solved Sudoku grid.

## What I Learned
- How to implement **backtracking algorithms** in C.  
- Importance of recursion in solving constraint-based problems.  
- Handling **2D arrays** and nested loops effectively.  
- Writing clean, modular code with helper functions.  
- Debugging logical errors in algorithmic problems.

## How It Could Be Improved
- Allow **user input** for Sudoku puzzles instead of hardcoding.  
- Add a **graphical interface (GUI)** for better visualization.  
- Implement **multiple solving strategies** (constraint propagation, dancing links).  
- Add **difficulty level detection** (easy, medium, hard).  
- Optimize performance for faster solving of complex puzzles.
